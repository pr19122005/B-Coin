# BCoin NFT Marketplace (Demo)

This is a demo project for an upcoming decentralized NFT marketplace app, currently in the development phase.

## 📌 Purpose

We are building a user-friendly NFT platform that:
- Displays NFTs listed on OpenSea using their API.
- Allows users to buy and sell NFTs using their own wallet via smart contracts.
- Ensures full transparency by handling all transactions on-chain, directly from the user's address.
- Uses OpenSea APIs **only for metadata display** (e.g., NFT images, price, title, and collection).

## 🔧 Technical Goals

- Integrate OpenSea SDK/API to fetch public NFT data.
- Use custom smart contracts to handle buy/sell logic.
- Allow users to interact via their wallet (e.g., MetaMask).
- No custody of user funds or NFTs – 100% decentralized transactions.

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

This repository is part of an early-stage demo setup for API access request. No live transactions or production features are active at the moment.
